# Trivia-Game

The theme of the game is from the beloved series called The Office.

## About

This is the 5th assignment for Northwestern's Bootcamp. 
The goal was to create a trivia game with a countdown timer that brings the player to a correct/incorrect/time up screen depending on the player's input or lack of input. 
Once all of the questions have been cycled through, the game will bring up the user's score and encourage them to play again.
